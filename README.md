# RJA Fecit

This project is a modern, production-ready web application built with a Next.js front-end and a FastAPI back-end. The front-end features a single, protected page that, after authentication via Clerk, allows users to fetch and display a list of random numbers from the back-end.

## Features

- **Front-end:** Next.js 14 with App Router, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and daisyUI.
- **Back-end:** FastAPI with Python 3.12.
- **Authentication:** Clerk for user authentication.
- **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose for local development and production builds.
- **Development Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, Vitest, React Testing Library, and k6 for load testing.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for continuous integration and release management.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

        subgraph "Web Service (Port 3000)"

        end
        subgraph "Backend Service (Port 8080)"
            C[FastAPI Backend]
        end
    end

    A -- "/api/random" --> B
    B -- "Proxies to /api/v1/random" --> C
    A -- "/api/v1/smorfia" --> B
    B -- "Reads from" --> E
    A -- "Authentication" --> D
```

### Backend API

The application uses two different backend endpoints to provide data to the frontend:

-   **/api/random**: This endpoint is a Next.js API route that acts as a proxy to the FastAPI backend. It forwards requests to the `/api/v1/random` endpoint on the backend service, which is running in a separate Docker container on port 8080. This approach is used to avoid CORS issues and to keep the frontend code clean and simple.

-   **/api/v1/smorfia**: This endpoint is also a Next.js API route, but it is served directly by the Next.js backend. It reads the `smorfia_napoletana.json` file from the `data` directory and returns its contents to the frontend. This is a simple and efficient way to serve static data that does not require a separate backend service.

### Authentication Flow

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant Next.js Frontend
    participant Clerk

    User->>Next.js Frontend: Accesses protected page
    Next.js Frontend->>Clerk: Redirects to login
    User->>Clerk: Enters credentials
    Clerk-->>Next.js Frontend: Returns with JWT
    Next.js Frontend->>User: Renders protected page
    User->>Next.js Frontend: Clicks "Get Random"
    Next.js Frontend->>Next.js Frontend: Fetches random numbers
    Next.js Frontend->>User: Displays numbers
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You will need to add your Clerk credentials to this file:

```dotenv
# Clerk Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key

# API Configuration
RANDOM_API_BASE=http://backend:8080

# Port Configuration
PORT=3000
```

To get your Clerk credentials:
1. Log in to https://dashboard.clerk.com â†’ select your app.
2. Open API Keys in the left-hand navigation.

### Installation and Running

#### Local Development (pnpm)

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    This will start the Next.js front-end and the FastAPI back-end concurrently.
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Docker

1.  **Build and run the Docker containers:**
    ```bash
    ./docker/buildrun.sh
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend Development

The FastAPI backend includes automatically generated documentation via Swagger UI. To access it, run the backend server and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

```bash
pnpm dev:backend
```

## Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `pnpm dev:backend`: Starts the FastAPI backend server.
- `pnpm dev:all`: Starts both the Next.js and FastAPI servers concurrently.
- `pnpm build`: Builds the application for production.
- `pnpm start`: Starts the production server.
- `pnpm lint`: Lints the codebase.
- `pnpm test`: Runs unit and integration tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e`: Runs end-to-end tests.
- `pnpm load-test`: Runs a load test with k6.
- `pnpm prepare`: Sets up Husky for pre-commit hooks.
